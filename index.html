# Today's goals

Showcase good practices for beginning and seasoned R users alike.  

Take some time to reflect on how we code or aspire to code: code for ourselves, our future selves, and others.

# WTF


## What They Forgot to Teach You About R

&lt;https://whattheyforgot.org&gt;  

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 

💜 THANK YOU Jenny Bryan, Jim Hester, &amp; so many other RStudio folks &amp; RLadies 💜

💜 Most of this is exactly or build directly from the work of others 💜

#Today's plan
To streamline your workflows in R:

1. Save the source, not the workspace 
  - Always start R with a blank slate
  - Restart R often
  - Avoid `rm(list = ls())`
2. Filepaths
  - Avoid `setwd("path/that/only/works/on/my/machine")`
  - Use `here`
3. Organize work into Projects
  - Use an IDE
  - Name files deliberately 
  - Filepaths with `here` (reprise)  
4. (Bonus) `usethis`
  - Configure git
  - Create template READMEs and Rmds
  - Thank contributors
  - Add a Code of Conduct

# 1. Saving source and blank slates


&lt;img src="images/if-you-liked-it-you-should-have-saved-the-source-for-it.jpg" width="100%" /&gt;

---
# Save the source, not the workspace.

Save the code that created the object, aka "source code"; do not save the object itself. 


&lt;!--- this also works: 
&lt;img src="images/dont-save-workspace.png" style="width: 60%" /&gt;
---&gt;


&lt;img src="images/rstudio-source.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


--
  
- Everything that really matters should be achieved through code that you save – including objects and figures
  - The contrast is storing them implicitly or explicitly, as part of an entire workspace, or saving them via the mouse.  

--

- Saving code is an absolute requirement for reproducibility.

- Renouncing `.Rdata` and restarting R provide constant pressure for you to do the right thing.

---
# Use an IDE
(integrated development environment)

When working with R, save your commands in a `.R` file ("script"), or in `.Rmd` ("R Markdown document"). It doesn't have to be polished. Just save it!

An [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE) is critical for making this workflow pleasant. 

--

Any good IDE offers: 

- a powerful, R-aware code editor 
- many ways to send your code to a running R process 
- other modern conveniences

This eliminates the temptation to develop code directly in the R Console. Instead, it becomes easier to do the right thing, which is to develop code in a `.R` or `.Rmd` file.

---

# Always start R with a blank slate

When you quit R, do not save the workspace to an `.Rdata` file. When you launch, do not reload the workspace from an `.Rdata` file.

In RStudio, set this via *Tools &gt; Global Options*.

&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/rstudio-workspace.png" alt="via R for Data Science" width="40%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;via R for Data Science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Restart R often during development

&gt; Have you tried turning it off and then on again?
&gt;
&gt; -- timeless troubleshooting wisdom, applies to everything

--

If you use RStudio, use the menu item *Session &gt; Restart R* or the associated keyboard shortcut.  

Additional keyboard shortcuts make it easy to restart development where you left off, i.e. to say "re-run all the code up to HERE":

&lt;img src="images/run-above.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Avoid `rm(list = ls())`

It's fairly common to see data analysis scripts that begin with this object-nuking command:


```r
rm(list = ls())
```

This is highly suggestive of a non-reproducible workflow.

--

This line is meant to reset things, either to power-cycle the current analysis or to switch from one project to another. But there are better ways to do both:

- To power-cycle the current analysis, restart R!
- To switch from one project to another, either restart R or, even better, use an IDE with proper support for projects, where each project gets its own R process.

--

**The problem with `rm(list = ls())` is that, given the intent, it does not go far enough.**  

All it does is delete user-created objects from the global workspace.

# 2. Filepaths 

---


# Filepaths preamble

- every saved thing gets a unique path 

&lt;img src="images/save-word.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Filepaths preamble

- every saved thing gets a unique path  

- your code runs from somewhere specific, and if it interacts with other things (data or other code), you need to tell your code where things are

--

- the more deliberate you are about where things live, 
  - the easier it will be for you &amp; future you
  - the easier it will be for other people
  - the easier it will be for other computers

---

# setwd("path/that/only/works/on/my/machine")

This is unideal.


```r
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/jenny/cuddly_broccoli/verbose_funicular/foofy/data")
df &lt;- read.delim("raw_foofy_data.csv")
p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("../figs/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```

--

The chance of the `setwd()` command having the desired effect -- making the file paths work -- for anyone besides its author is 0%. 

--

It's also unlikely to work for the author one or two years or computers from now. 

--

Hard-wired, absolute paths, especially when sprinkled throughout the code, make a project brittle. Such code does not travel well across time or space.

---
# setwd()

BUT, if you still decide to use `setwd()` in your scripts, you should at least be very disciplined about it:

- Only use `setwd()` at the very start of a file, i.e. in an obvious and predictable place. If someone has to hand-edit all of these, make it easy for them.  

- Always set working directory to the same thing, namely to the top-level of the project (not a subdirectory). Always build subsequent paths relative to that. 

---
# setwd() — compare: 

Unideal:


```r
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/jenny/cuddly_broccoli/verbose_funicular/foofy/data")
df &lt;- read.delim("raw_foofy_data.csv")
p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("../figs/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```

Less unideal: 


```r
setwd("/Users/jenny/cuddly_broccoli/verbose_funicular/foofy")
    
library(ggplot2)
df &lt;- read.delim("data/raw_foofy_data.csv")
p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("figs/foofy_scatterplot.png")
```


---

# setwd() — compare:

Way more ideal:

```
here::here()
```


Hang tight; we'll come back to this soon.

---
# If you like `setwd()`, then carry on

If you use `setwd("path/that/only/works/on/my/machine")` and it does not cause you or your collaborators grief, then I am happy for you. Carry on. This was my practice as well for many years.

Only you can decide how much you care about this (from [Jenny's original blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)).

--

But eventually I admitted that this *did* cause me grief whenever I moved my files, collaborated on an analysis with a colleague, or got a new computer.

You can design this particular aggravation out of your life.

# 3. Project-oriented workflows


---

# Dilemma and a solution

Problem statement:

  * We want to work on project A with R's working directory set to `path/to/projectA` and on project B with R's working directory set to `path/to/projectB`.
  * But we also want to keep code like `setwd("path/to/projectA")` out of our `.R` scripts.

--

I strongly recommend using an IDE that supports a project-based workflow. This eliminates the tension between your development convenience and the portability of the code.

---
# Organize work into projects
 
Here's what I mean by "work in a project":

- File system discipline: put all the files related to a project in a designated folder.

  - This applies to data, code, figures, notes, etc.
  - Depending on project complexity, you might enforce further organization into subfolders.

--

- Working directory intentionality: when working on project A, make sure working directory is set to project A's folder.
  - Ideally, this is achieved via the development workflow and tooling, not by baking absolute paths into the code.

--

- File path discipline: all paths are relative — relative to the project's folder.


---
# Organize work into projects

Synergistic habits: you'll get the biggest payoff if you practice all of them together.

Portability: the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still "just work".This is the only practical convention that creates **reliable, polite behavior** across different computers/users/time. This convention is neither new, nor unique to R.

--

It's like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.

---
# RStudio Projects

The RStudio IDE has a notion of a (capital "P") [Project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects), which is a very effective implementation of the (small "p") projects described above. 

--

They are the same “unit” as a GitHub repo!

--

You can designate a new or existing folder as a Project. All this means is that RStudio leaves a file, e.g., `foofy.Rproj`, in the folder, which is used to store settings specific to that project. Use *File &gt; New Project ...* to get started.

--

Double-click on a `.Rproj` file to open a fresh instance of RStudio, with the working directory and file browser pointed at the project folder.
  
  
---
# RStudio Projects
 
You can have multiple Projects going at once!

This--

 allows rapid context switching across several projects, such as an R package, teaching material, and a data analysis. There is no danger of crosstalk between the projects: each has its own R process, global workspace, and working directory.


&lt;img src="images/multiple-rstudio-projects.png" width="100%" /&gt;

# Where to keep Projects

One suggestion for organizing:

.pull-left[**Have a dedicated folder for your Projects.**  
- Jenny: `~/rrr/`.   
- Julie: `~/github/`.  

If you have One Main Place for Projects, then go there in Finder/File Explorer to launch any specific project with `.Rproj`.
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="images/github-folder.png" width="80%" /&gt;

]

---
# Where to keep Projects

I'm also toying with this idea: sub-organization by GitHub User/Organization. 

&lt;img src="images/github-folder-subfolders.png" width="80%" /&gt;


---

# Tr
icks for opening Projects

Once you decide "I want to do some work in Project K", there are various ways to accelerate the startup process. 

**RStudio knows about recently used Projects.** Once you are in RStudio, there are several ways to access other Projects you've recently worked in. In the upper right corner is a drop-down menu with various Project- and session-related goodies in it.

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="images/rstudio-project-switching.png" width="70%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
Use the "arrow and paper" icon to open a Project in a separate RStudio instance, while also leaving the Project you're launching it from open.

# 4. here

---
# `here`

`here()` identifies your project's files, based on the current working directory at the time when the package is loaded.


```r
library(here)
```

```
## here() starts at /Users/lowndes/github/jules32/streamlined-workflows
```

```r
here()
```

```
## [1] "/Users/lowndes/github/jules32/streamlined-workflows"
```

--

If you want to understand why, use `dr_here()`.  

If you need to set a place manually, use `set_here()`.

Those are the only 3 functions in the `here()` package.

---
# `here` example: Foofy

This will run, with no edits, for anyone who follows the convention about launching R in the project folder.


```r
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

df &lt;- read.delim(here("data", "raw_foofy_data.csv"))
p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
ggsave(here("figs", "foofy_scatterplot.png"))
```

--

In fact, it will even work if R’s working directory is anywhere inside the project, i.e. it will work from sub-folders. This plays well with knitr/rmarkdown’s default behavior around working directory and in package development/checking workflows.

---
# `here` example: Ocean Health Index

Constraint: Our workflow (`ohicore` package) requires having the working directory set to a subfolder, e.g. `bhi/baltic`. 

-- 

But setting relative paths wouldn’t work for our users

-- 

And RMarkdown files are not always launched from the Console's working directory

-- 

Our solution: We set up a convention everyone had to follow: Create a `~/github/` folder in their root directory

So all our script could say `setwd(“~/github/bhi/baltic”)` 

-- 

Now, transitioning to `setwd(here(“baltic”))`

Not really the intent of `here`, but iterative steps towards better practice

---
# OHI Team musings: why would you use `here` if you already use .Rproj?

- Makes it less ambiguous about where things are/what is going on 
  - as opposed to `../../../somewhere/`

--

- We sometimes work between Projects
  - could move away from convention of having a folder named `~/github/`
  - `here("..", "esw")` could help between Mac/PC slashes
  - `set_here()` is not the same as `setwd(here())` — could this be a way forward?

--  
  
Also, if using `here` and `.Rproj` is redundant, that's better than being unprepared...you will collaborate with people who don't use `.Rproj` but you could alleviate filepath woes this way as a starting point

# 4. Tips from `usethis`

---
# `usethis`

From &lt;https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html&gt;:

`usethis` is a workflow package: it automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.

--

Most `use_*()` functions operate on the active project: literally, a directory on your computer. 

--

A few `usethis` functions have no strong connections to projects and will expect you to provide a path.

--

`usethis` is quite chatty, explaining what it’s doing and assigning you tasks. ✔ indicates something usethis has done for you. ● indicates that you’ll need to do some work yourself.

# Add an RMarkdown Template

Adds files and directories necessary to add a custom rmarkdown template to RStudio. It creates:

- `inst/rmarkdown/templates/{{template_dir}}`. Main directory.
- `skeleton/skeleton.Rmd`. Your template Rmd file.
- `template.yml` with basic information filled in.



```r
usethis::use_rmarkdown_template()
```

---
# Create README files

Live demo:


```r
usethis::use_readme_md()
```

And, let's make a README.Rmd and learn why we would ever want to:


```r
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```
